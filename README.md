# The-Cheaters-Gambit
## The chess game with a twist!


### What is "The Cheater's Gambit"
The Cheater's Gambit is a chess game with a twist, the twist being you are **permitted** to cheat! In most games, the rules are to be followed to the letter, and violations of such rules typically results in instant disqualification. Not here though, in The Cheater's Gambit, cheating is the name of the game.

### How do you play?
Player's can equip up to 5 different kind of cheats before they start a game from a large list of cheats that they have on their accounts. Then, once they are in the game, they will be allowed to use those cheats throughout the game, but only a certain amount of times which depends on the cheat you are using.

### Are there different game modes? 
Yes! I plan on having a few different game modes that players can choose from! 

### Development Roadmap
1. Initial Local Multiplayer Build
